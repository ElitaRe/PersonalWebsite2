             <p>Me & my family</p>
             <p> So I am an 18 years old girl living with her family. I live with my mom, dad and brother who is younger
             than me, so we are a four members family. We live a very happy life and I am grateful for everything I
             have in my life. I am the only girl in the whole family so I am used to everyone's love for me. As I also
             mentioned, I have lived 4 years in Prizren without my family and it was a good experience for me, because
             it was like a preparation to live life without being dependent on my parents.</p>

             <p>My free time</p>
             <p>As a student, I am quite busy on weekdays. However, at weekends, I have much free time, so I usually spend 
         it on relaxing to prepare for a coming busy week.I like to watch youtube videos and read articles that have to 
         do with my career, to improve my self more in that field.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA" 
         target="_blank" >(like this one)</a> So I am a person who enjoys the free time more at
         home with family. But I also have wonderful friends, that is impossible not to spend time with 
         them. And of course as most of the people I aslo like to visit different places.</p>

             <p>Hobbies</p>
             <p>Hobbies play a very important role in our lives. They occupy our minds when we are free and also make us happy.
             Hobbies are our escape from the real world that makes us forget our worries. Moreover, they make our lives
             interesting and enjoyable. If we look at it, all our hobbies are very useful for us. They teach us a lot of things
             about different stuff. They also help in expanding our knowledge. <br>
